Logistic Regression Final Model Performance & Key Insights:

- The final logistic regression model concluded that the following variables had an acceptable p-value after dropping variables with too high p-values, meaning these variables accepted the null hypothesis that the correlation coefficient didn't actually equal 0, meaning it does have a significant enough affect on the y variable to be included in the analysis: 'const', 'no_of_adults', 'no_of_children', 'no_of_weekend_nights', 'no_of_week_nights', 'required_car_parking_space', 'lead_time', 'arrival_year', 'arrival_month', 'repeated_guest', 'no_of_previous_cancellations', 'avg_price_per_room', 'no_of_special_requests', 'type_of_meal_plan_Meal Plan 2', 'type_of_meal_plan_Not Selected', 'room_type_reserved_Room_Type 2', 'room_type_reserved_Room_Type 4', 'room_type_reserved_Room_Type 5', 'room_type_reserved_Room_Type 6', 'room_type_reserved_Room_Type 7', 'market_segment_type_Corporate', 'market_segment_type_Offline'
- These columns were determined by eliminating muticollinearity, and then identifying the remaining variables that significantly impacted the independent variable (hotel cancellations).
- The final logistic regression had no multicollinearity, all acceptable p-values; and accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 scores are very similar between testing and training data.


Decision Tree Final Model Performance & Key Insights:

- There was originally overfitting in the deciion tree model according to the train/test confusion matricies. So, I used pruning to refine the model.
- After trying pre-pruning, we see the importance features have changed dramatically. There are far fewer variables that seem to play a role in determining the classification of the y variable.The scores were still fairly high, and they are extremely close. This means the model is able to provide more generaalizeable results, so it can more accureately predict on unseen data.
- After trying post-pruning, all the measures were pretty close, especially the f1 measure, which is the measure we are most concerned with. This means the post-pruned model is also producing generalizable results, which means it is effective at predicting on unseen data.
- After comparing the accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 scores between the original decision tree, pre-pruned decision tree, and post-pruned decision tree mosels, I decided the best fit model would be the post-pruned decision tree with a F1 score of 0.808. I prioritized the F1 score since both of the possible errors in the predictive model (false positives and false negatives) are equally important in this context.


Actionable Insights and Recommendations for INN Hotels:

- The model built can be used to predict if a hotel room booking is going to cancel or not and can correctly identify 85.6% of the canceled bookings.
- The amount of time in advance the room was booked, whether the market segment type was online, and the average price per room were the most important variables in predicting whether a a booking will be cancelled or not.
- From the decision tree, it has been observed that if the lead time is less than or equal to 16.50, the number of special requests is less than or equal to 0.5, it is not from the market segment online, the number of weekend nights the booking is for is less than or equal to 0.5, the average price per room is less than or equal to 68.50, it is not from the market segment offline, and the arrival date is the 30th of the month or later, the booking is likley to cancel.
- The company should give a vigilant eye for these values in order to detect machine failure. However, there are a number or these combinations that could be a signal that the booking will cancel, and it would be impossible to memorize each combination. So, I reccommend the hotel company creates a website through which the customers can book their hotel, and for each booking, the website runs it through the post-pruned predictive model created above, and if it falls into the 1 categpry (predictedd to cancel), the manager is notified, and they are able to rearrange or plan accordingly.
- The profitable policies for cancellations and refunds that I would advise the hotel to adopt is that if a booking fits the above criteria, or any of the other combinations predicted to fall into the cancelled category, they arrange for at least half of these bookings to be cancelled, and fill the room with a different booking instead. That way, in case they do not cancel even if they were predicted to (False positive), there would likley still be an empty room for them, but if they do cancel, at least half of the cancelled bookings were rebooked in preparation, and the hotel significantly decreases their financial losses from cancellations.
- Another suggestion I have for the hotel company is that because the data provided for this analysis was from part of 2017 through 2018, I would advise the company to continue collecting this same data (mostly the important features though), and provide it to a data scientist to re-perform this analysis so they can get more up to date results
